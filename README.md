# moreSECYAN: An update to Secure Yannakakis

I am currently trying to do some update work to SECYAN(https://github.com/hkustDB/SECYAN). 

For example:
- Adding differencial privacy to protect the query result.
- Trying to utilize a verifiable PSI for the Malicious Setting.
- Adding a nice looking frontend.

See "READMEoriginal" for Original information.
